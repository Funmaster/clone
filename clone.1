.Nm
is a file tree cloning tool which runs 3 threads - a scheduler (main), a reader, and a writer thread.
Reading and writing occurs in parallel. While this is most beneficial for transferring data from one
physical disk to another,
.Nm
is also very well suited for cloning a file tree to any place on the same disk. Cloning includes the
whole directory hierarchy, i.e. sub-directories, files, hard links, symbolic links, attributes (modes,
flags, times), extended attributes and access control lists.
.Pp
.Ar source/
designates the path to the root node of file tree to be cloned.
.Pp
.Ar destination/
designates the path to the cloned file tree. If the destination directory
does not exist, then it will be created.
.Pp
For example, cloning a whole file hierarchy of in total 2.3 TBytes of data from one hard disk to another took on a given setup 7.5 h, so the
average transfer rate for all kind of files (very small up to very big ones) was about 89 MByte/s.
.Pp
.Nm
is useful for cloning (thus backing-up) live file systems. Works on FreeBSD and Darwin (Mac OS X).
