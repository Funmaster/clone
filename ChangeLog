2013-08-12 23:20  rj - r42

   * clone.c
     - NFS and other file systems don't have file creation dates, so desconsider st_birthtimespec in these cases.

•••• 2013-06-27 -- Created a snapshot of r41 for release as v1.0.2, provided it for download at GC, and submitted it to FreeBSD ports ••••

2013-06-27 10:03  rj - r41

   * clone.c
     - fixed deletion of directories and files in the destination in synchronization mode
     - release of version to 1.0.2 (r41)

2013-06-01 04:13  rj - r40

   * clone.c, utils.h:
     - formatting, orthography

2013-02-23 13:18  rj - r39

   * clone.c, utils.h:
     - streamlined stage passing between reader() and writer()

2013-02-22 11:10  rj - r38

   * clone.c:
     - qitems are kept initialized in the dispenser, so, no need to initialize them again in dispenseNewQItem()
     - removed unecessary helper variables and constructs from writer()
     - in writer() clean-up everything at one central stage below the cleanfinish label
     - release src and dst paths in reverse order as they were allocated, i.e. free() dst first
     - set version to 1.0.2b


•••• 2013-02-20 -- Created a snapshot of r37 for release as v1.0.1, provided it for download at GC, and submitted it to FreeBSD ports ••••


2013-02-20 23:29  rj - r37

   * ChangeLog:
     - release of version 1.0.1 (r37)

2013-02-20 21:55  rj - r36

   * clone.c:
     - when reading, do not assume anything about the file size
     - when the field d_type of struct dirent is DT_UNDEFINED, then call lstat() to obtain the type
     - rename fileCopy() to fileCopyScheduler()
     - dispense virgin qitems, set stage to nascent in the fileCopyScheduler()

2013-02-20 11:00  rj - r35

   * clone.c:
     - if the file size changed in-between scheduling and copying, then most probably
       other file attributes changed too, so lstat() the source again.
     - set version to 1.0.1

2013-02-20 01:08  rj - r34

   * clone.c:
     - on reading and writing, check only for real errors,
       e.g., an actual file size difference counts not as error.

2013-02-19 12:35  rj - r33

   * ChangeLog:
     - entry r32: corrected timestamp 06:18 to 12:18
     - entry r28: rights and obligations has been transferred from Cyclaero Ltda. to Dr. Rolf Jansen.

2013-02-19 12:18  rj - r32

   * ChangeLog, clone.c:
     - added ChangeLog
     - set version to 1.0.1b

2013-02-18 18:54  rj - r31

   * Makefile, clone.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
     - switched back to the former method of obtaining the svn revision on update.

2013-02-18 18:28  rj - r30

   * clone.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj, utils.c:
     - minor polishing

2013-02-17 23:08  rj - r29

   * clone.c, utils.c, utils.h:
     - move setAttributes() out of the conditional compiling section, i.e. making it common.
     - instead, rename setTimes() to setTimesFlags() and move it into the conditional compiling section.
     - On Mac OS X, the flags need to be set before the times, and on FreeBSD the flags
       need to be set after the times -- in this respect, nothing has changed for FreeBSD.
     - some minor code formatting.

2013-02-17 12:40  rj - r28

   * Makefile, clone.1, clone.c, utils.c, utils.h:
     - Herewith, transferred all rights and obligations on the clone project, including
       copyright, from the Legal Entity Cyclaero Ltda. to the Natural Person Dr. Rolf Jansen.

2013-02-15 00:45  rj - r27

   * clone.c, utils.c:
     - on Mac OS X, setTimes() must be the last call in setAttributes.
     - on FreeBSD, lchflags() must be the last call (so it was before).

2013-02-15 00:30  rj - r26

   * clone.c, utils.c:
     - on Mac OS X, the d_type field of struct dirent does not reliable indicate
       the type for external file systems (e.g. NFS shares, UDF volumes, ??),
       therefore, need to switch most of the calls to stat() to lstat(),
       and extract the file type from the st_mode field of struct stat.
     - setTimes() shall be the final call in setAttributes, or in some cases
       the modifications time become not set.

2013-02-11 15:05  rj - r25

   * clone.1, clone.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj:
     - changed line-ending of man file from CRLF to LF
     - in the Xcode project enabled syntax coloring for the man file
     - removed the directory "related stuff" from the Xcode project

     - fixed a crashing bug in synchronization mode
     - don't require modification dates of directories being the same for synchronization or incremental update

2013-02-08 12:20  rj - r20

   * clone.1:
     - minor lingual clarification in the descriptive text (transferring -> copying)

2013-02-08 12:06  rj - r19

   * Makefile:
     - soft-define the desired compiler

2013-01-26 01:52 (BRST)  rolf - r15 (local)

   * clone.c:
     - instead of doing nothing create the directory (mount point) of source trees

2013-01-26 01:27 (BRST)  rolf - r14 (local)
